# Diamond 

## Project Idea: 
After dating his girlfriend since their college years, Tom decides to propose and begins searching for the perfect diamond. However, he is unsure about which diamond to choose. Our project develops a model that, based on Tom’s budget, recommends the best diamond for his engagement ring.


## Bio: 
Diamonds are formed deep within the Earth's mantle, under extreme heat and pressure, where carbon atoms crystallize over millions of years. Most diamonds originate 100-200 miles below the surface and are brought closer to the Earth’s crust through volcanic eruptions via kimberlite pipes. These natural processes create the sparkling gems prized for their rarity and beauty. Some diamonds are also lab-grown, created in controlled environments using high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods, replicating natural conditions.

## How Diamond Prices Are Set:

The price of a diamond is determined by evaluating several key factors, commonly known as the "Four Cs":

Carat: The weight of the diamond, with larger diamonds generally being more expensive due to their rarity.
Cut: The quality of the diamond’s cut affects its brilliance and sparkle. A well-cut diamond reflects light better, increasing its value.
Clarity: This measures the presence of inclusions or blemishes. Flawless diamonds are rarer and command higher prices.
Color: Diamonds are graded on a scale from D (colorless) to Z (light yellow). Colorless diamonds are typically more valuable.
Key Factors Influencing Price

Beyond the Four Cs, other factors impact diamond pricing:

Shape: Popular shapes like round brilliants often cost more than less common shapes like marquise or pear due to demand and cutting complexity.
Fluorescence: Some diamonds glow under UV light, which can lower or increase value depending on intensity and market preferences.
Certification: Diamonds certified by reputable organizations like GIA or AGS are priced higher due to verified quality.
Market Demand and Trends: Consumer preferences, economic conditions, and trends (e.g., lab-grown vs. natural diamonds) influence pricing.
Source and Ethical Considerations: Conflict-free or sustainably sourced diamonds may carry a premium due to ethical demand.
By analyzing these factors, your ML diamond predictor model can help estimate diamond prices accurately, aiding buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.
